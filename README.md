# React Initial State Lab

## Overview

In this lab, you'll set initial state in a React component and distinguish
between state and props.

## Image slider

Let's pretend we're making an awesome slider for our new portfolio site.
Naturally, we'll use React to do so! We have to start somewhere, so in this lab
we'll just focus on setting up the initial state of the slider.

## A bomb timer

Take a moment to think about what a bomb does and how it works. Don't get all
into the nitty gritty â€” what we're going to focus on right now is the _timer_.

Let's create a component that represents a bomb timer that counts down until it
reaches `0`.

2.  The initial value of `secondsLeft` is set by passing in an `initialCount`
    prop to the `Bomb` component. Don't forget to pass the argument props into
    the constructor (i.e., `constructor(props)`).
3.  It should render the text `'<SECONDS_LEFT> seconds left before I go boom!'`,
    where `<SECONDS_LEFT>` is the value of `secondsLeft`.
4.  **If `secondsLeft` equals `0`, it should render `'Boom!'` instead.**
